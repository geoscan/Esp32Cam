# About
Automation scripts for working with ESP32 under the following configuration:
ESP32 + JTAG + JLink + OpenOCD.

# Content
jlinkesp32.py - create init file, run GDB server.
jlinkgdbrun.py - create init file, run GDB client.
jlinkpaths.py - path constants, should be adapted to a working environment.

Feel free to tune those scripts, because most likely you will have to.
